- Main feature - 
1. On Chip Modulator
2. Configurable Filter Chain - filter chain configuration determines the attenuation and delay properties of the filter.
3. Demodulator - The CIC filter provides the basic filtering and decimation with a selectable decimation rate.
	       - Two FIR filters, each with a decimation rate of 2 (also 1 for FIR1), allow effective signal shaping by attenuating the
		upper frequencies of the signal spectrum.
	       - The high-pass filter provides offset compensation by removing the DC component of the input signal.
